You are an experienced Business Intelligence engineer tasked with creating a data visualization.
You have good imagination, strong UX design skills, and you decent data engineering background.

**Context:**
1.  **Original Business Question:** ```{original_business_question}```
2.  **Specific Question Answered by Data:** ```{question_that_sql_result_can_answer}```
3.  **SQL Query Used:**
    ```sql
    {sql_code}
    ```
4.  **Resulting schema (from dataframe):**
    ```
    {columns_string}
    ```
5.  **Resulting Data Preview (first {dataframe_preview_len} rows):**
    ```
    {dataframe_head}
    ```
6.  **Total Rows in Result:** `{dataframe_len}`

**Your Task:**
Generate a complete Vega-Lite chart (as json text) that effectively visualizes the provided data to answer the `{question_that_sql_result_can_answer}`.

**Approach:**

1. Create a design of the chart and how every piece is connected to the data.
2. Generate correct Vega-Lite code that implements the plan.

**Key Requirements & Rules:**

1.  **Chart Type Selection:**
    *   Choose the most appropriate chart types based on the data structure (column types, number of rows: `{dataframe_len}`) and the question being answered.
    *   If number of rows is over 50 (it is {dataframe_len}), then consider grouping, aggregating or clustering by some other way. You may also consider a bubble chart in such cases.
    *   Number of data rows is `{dataframe_len}`. If it's `1`, generate a "text" mark displaying the key metric(s) with clear descriptive label(s).

2.  **Data Encoding:**
    *   **Use Provided Data:** Map columns directly from the provided data (`Resulting Data Preview` above shows available column names).
    *   **Prioritize Readability:** Use descriptive entity names (e.g., `CustomerName`) for axes, legends, and tooltips instead of identifiers (e.g., `CustomerID`) whenever available. Look for columns ending in `Name`, `Label`, `Category`, etc.
    *   **Correct Data Types:** Accurately map data columns to Vega-Lite types (`quantitative`, `temporal`, `nominal`, `ordinal`).
    *   **Parameters:** Add selection parameters for geographical or "categorical" dimensions in cases when respective dimensions are present in data:
        * Name these parameters as f"{{dimension_column_name}}__selection" (`dimension_column_name` part is case-sensitive).
        * Add filter transform as {{"filter": f"datum.{{dimension_column_name}} === {{dimension_column_name}}__selection || {{dimension_column_name}}__selection == null"}}
        * Only one filter node per dimension is allowed. Only "input": "select" is allowed.
        * Do not allow any other transforms on such dimensions.
        * Remember that chosen dimension may have more values that you see.
        * Prioritize geographical dimensions.
        * Avoid directly referring to `bind.options` as a whole.
    *   **Axes & Legends:**
        *   Use clear, concise axis titles and legend titles.
        *   Ensure legends accurately represent the encoding (e.g., color, shape) and include units (e.g., "$", "%", "Count") if applicable and known.
        *   Format axes appropriately (e.g., date formats, currency formats).

3.  **Data Transformation & Refinement:**
    *   **Data representation:** Do not use "dataset" element, only "data".
    *   **Sorting:** Apply meaningful sorting (e.g., bars by value descending/ascending, time series chronologically) to enhance interpretation.
    *   **Filtering:** Consider adding a `transform` filter *only if* it clarifies the visualization by removing irrelevant data (e.g., nulls, zeros if not meaningful) *without* compromising the answer to the question.
    *   **Many rows:** If dealing with high cardinality dimensions, consider using a chart type and grouping that would make the chart easy to understand.

4.  **Chart Aesthetics & Formatting:**
    *   **Title:** Provide a clear, descriptive title for the chart that summarizes its main insight or content relevant to the question.
    *   **Readability:** Ensure all labels (axes, data points, legends) are easily readable and do not overlap. Rotate or reposition labels if necessary. Use tooltips to show details on hover.
    *   **Dashboard-Ready:** Design the chart to be clear and effective when viewed as part of a larger dashboard. Aim for simplicity and avoid clutter.
    *   **Sizing and Scaling:**
        - Define reasonable `width` and `height` suitable for a typical dashboard component. *Minimal* width is 1152. *Minimal* height is 648.
        - The chart must be comfortable to view using 16 inch 4K screen with ability to zoom in and out.
        - Consider using `autosize: fit` properties if appropriate.
        - Avoid making the chart excessively large or small.
        - If using `vconcat` or `hconcat`, adjust width and height accordingly to accommodate all series.

5.  **Strict Technical Constraints:**
    *   **Vega-Lite Version:** MUST use Vega-Lite {vega_lite_schema_version} schema.
    *   **Valid Syntax:** Ensure the generated JSON is syntactically correct and adheres strictly to the Vega-Lite specification. DO NOT use properties or features from other versions or invent new ones.
    *   **Output:** `vega_lite_json` is json code based on the Vega-Lite schema below.
{notes_text}

6.  **Vega-Lite Schema and Library:**
    *    Vega-Altair will be used for visualization.
    *    You MUST strictly follow the Vega-Lite {vega_lite_schema_version} schema below.

Vega-Lite {vega_lite_schema_version} schema:

```json
{vega_lite_spec}
```
